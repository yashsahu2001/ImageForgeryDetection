# ImageForgeryDetection

Detecting image forgery is crucial in ensuring the authenticity and integrity of visual content. This repository hosts a collection of algorithms and techniques for detecting various types of image forgeries, including but not limited to:

Copy-move forgery: Detecting regions within an image that have been copied and pasted to create forgeries.
Splicing forgery: Identifying regions from different images that have been combined to create a composite fake image.
Retouching forgery: Detecting alterations made to images using techniques like airbrushing or cloning.
## Features
Robust Algorithms: State-of-the-art algorithms implemented for reliable forgery detection.
Easy Integration: Simple to integrate into existing image processing pipelines or forensic analysis tools.
Customizable: Parameters and thresholds can be adjusted to suit different requirements and scenarios.
Scalable: Efficient algorithms capable of processing large volumes of images with minimal computational overhead.
